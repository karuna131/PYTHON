## Explaintion

1. First of all I created a function is nonDivisiblesubset .

2. In which I passed two argument s and k. s is list and k is divisior.

3. Here i used some funtions.
```
max()
    I used max() function that will give maximum element in list.
    
append()
       It is function that adds a element to list. 
```

4. I find out frequency of divisor by this formula.
```
frequncy[i%k]+=1 a
```
5. and returned the maxvalue to output.
