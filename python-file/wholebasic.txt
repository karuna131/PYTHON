A file is some information or data which stays in the computer storage devices. 
You already know about different kinds of file , like your music files, video files, text files. 
Python gives you easy ways to manipulate these files. 
Generally we divide files in two categories, text file and binary file. 
Text files are simple text where as the binary files contain binary data which is only readable by computer.
“r” -> open read only, you can read the file but can not edit / delete anything inside
“w” -> open with write power, means if the file exists then delete all content and open it to write
“a” -> open in append mode
